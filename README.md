FlatSpace
=========

This is a rebuilt version of the game located here: http://www.lewpen.com/games/flatspace/
It is built in Java and is made using the StdDraw class made by Princeton Intro to CS.
http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/

Currently the game supports boxes being able to be broken by the laser bullets, but there is no way to lose currently.
The score merely goes up an infinite amount of times.

Controls:
Use the mouse to target boxes, and click to move the spaceship forward in that direction.

Debug Controls:
 - F1: Fancy Graphics Mode (experimental)
 - F2: Invinciblity Mode
 - F3: Debug Menu, with info (E = Entities, S = Bullets Fired, T = Program Clock)
 - F4: Bullets Off
