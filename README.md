FlatSpace
=========

This is a rebuilt version of the game located here: http://www.lewpen.com/games/flatspace/
It is built in Java and is made using the StdDraw class made by Princeton Intro to CS.
http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/

Currently the game supports boxes being able to be broken by the laser bullets, but there is no way to lose currently.
The score merely goes up an infinite amount of times.

Controls:
Use the mouse to target boxes, and click to move the spaceship forward in that direction.
Press F3 to open the debug menu (just like Minecraft!!)
 - E: The amount of entities (blocks & bullets) plotted on the screen
 - S: The amount of bullets fired
 - T: The clock for creating new boxes, when it reaches 30 a new box and a new bullet spawns
